How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    highlights lines that are different, programmer can quickly see if there is a coding error

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    if i needed an old feature or if the current version is broken code

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    i only want to save working copies of my code, also sometimes i make temporary changes that doesn't need to be saved

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    a program often requires multiple files to work together, documents are independent

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log shows version history and comments for a repository. git diff shows a comparison of text differences between two commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    git saves a copy of your repository everytime u commit, so if you break the program unexpectedly, you know you always have the previous working copies to revert back to.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    my own projects
